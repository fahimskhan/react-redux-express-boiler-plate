## Instructions
- Run npm install in the root folder
- Run yarn inside of the client folder
- Make sure to use npm install when in the root directory when adding npm modules
- Make sure to use yarn for the client directory for adding npm modules
- Note that the proxy from create-react-app has /api prepended to all of the routes
- Feel free to change it in any way that you like
- Use npm run server for running the server only
- Use npm run client when running the front end only
- Use npm run dev for running the client and the server simultaneously


This boilerplate is just a skeleton of a full-stack app using Node, Express, React, and Redux together.
The front end is created and using create-react-app for its build.
You may use any CSS libraries of your choice as it hasn't been configured yet.
